#### Technical Details
All accounting inside the Tyche vault is easiest to understand by evaluating everything with respect to the rebase index.

- V_a: Agnostic OHM value (# of sOHM / current_index)
- Di: Index at time of donor deposit
- Wi: Index at time of donor withdrawal
- Ri_n: Index at nth redemption by recipient

For Donors:
```
Withdrawal Amount = V_a * Wi
```

For Recipient:
```
Redeem Amount
	= V_a (Ri_n - Ri_{n-1} - Di)
							
	= V_a Ri_n - V_a Ri_{n-1} - V_a Di
		where V_a Di is the sOHM amount deposited by donor
```
